Basic website built using the Django framework.

The url location is at tangowithrango.pythonanywhere.com/rango/

This website was built from scratch based upon a tutorial on learning Django.
It features many aspects of the framework such as dealing with databases, static files,
forms, user authentication, and cookies and sessions.

In addition, I utilized a Bing Search API to allow clients to search for pages 
not available on the website. 

The overall website contains a list of categories and category-specific pages that
were most viewed by clients accessing website. Clients also are allowed to add
more categories and pages by registering for an account.
